# LeetCode Solutions 🚀

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions! This collection documents my journey in mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using **Go (Golang)**.

## 📚 About

This repository serves as a personal log of my daily problem-solving practice. I aim to improve my coding skills, understand complex algorithms, and write efficient, clean code. Each solution includes the approach taken and, where applicable, comments explaining the logic.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by topic or pattern to make navigation easier:

- **Binary Tree**: Basic implementations and traversals.
- **Linked List**: Operations like reversing, merging, and removing nodes.
- **Two Pointers**: Solutions utilizing the two-pointer technique.
- **Daily Challenges**: Solutions to LeetCode's daily problems.
- **Random**: Various problems picked up for practice.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language**: Go (Golang)

## 📝 Solved Problems Highlights

Here are a few examples of problems I have tackled:

| Problem | Category | Difficulty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimize-maximum-pair-sum-in-array/) | Greedy / Sorting | Medium |
| [Merge In Between Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-in-between-linked-lists/) | Linked List | Medium |
| [Remove Nodes From Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nodes-from-linked-list/) | Linked List | Medium |
| [Plus One](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one/) | Array / Math | Easy |
| Reverse Linked List II | Linked List | Medium |

## 🚀 How to Run

To run any specific solution, navigate to the folder and use the `go run` command:

```bash
cd path/to/problem
go run main.go
```

## 📈 Goals

- Consistency in solving problems.
- Deepening understanding of DSA concepts.
- Writing optimized and readable code.
